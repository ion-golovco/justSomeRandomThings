                    North Korea claims to operate under the "Juche" 
                    ideology, or "rejecting dependence on others, 
                    using one’s own brains, and believing in one’s own strength," 
                    according to Kim Il-Sung. Although not technically 
                    Communist, many of these ideas stem from ideologies of previous 
                    Communist leaders.
